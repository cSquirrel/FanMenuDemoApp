# FanMenuDemoApp

Key points:
* the main work is contained in [FanMenuViewUIKit.swift](FanMenuComponent/FanMenuViewUIKit.swift) file
* the implementation:
   * supports tap and drag to open the menu,
   * is at "proof of concept" stage therefore is verbose and not optimised in any way ( copy'n'paste code)
* video capture of the feature
